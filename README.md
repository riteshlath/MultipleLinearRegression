## General Information
- Bookbikes provides bike-sharing service in US market and they need to identify the factors affecting the demand for the service.
- What is the background of your project?
Bookbikes has suffered considerable dips in revenue due to ongoing COVID pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve?
BoomBikes thus aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
Boombikes thus needs to understand the factors that influence the demand for bike-sharing service. 
- What is the dataset that is being used?
The dataset contains daily data from 2018 and 2019 about the demand for bike sharing service quantified through total users alongwith day parameters such as weekdays, holiday, workingday, month, year and other parameters for season and weather conditions.  
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The features positively affecting the demand is year, temperature (feels like) and winter season.
- The features negatively affecting the demand is windspeed and misty weather.
